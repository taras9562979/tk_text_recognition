Schematic Neural_Net visualization:
    i) Insert Mode <--> Move Mode <--> Connect Mode <--> Delete Mode (switches by respective Button left-click)
    ii) Insert Mode -> draws Nodes on the Canvas (mouse left-click)
                       Nodes values(initially generated randomly) for Input Nodes are displayed inside the Node
    iii) Move Mode -> (mouse drag-and-drop)
    iv) Connect Mode ->connect existing Nodes by Arrows (1st left-click -> choose Start Nodes
                                                         2nd left-click -> choose End Node and draw an Arrows)
        * if a pair [Start Node, End Node] already exists, new connection is not made
    v) Delete Mode -> deletes Node (all Arrows relating to this Node are deleted as well)
    vi) Calculate Mode -> performs Forward Propagation(initially) using Node Values and Weights

    * some parameters are displayed on web console for testing purposes
